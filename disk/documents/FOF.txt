FRESH OUT OF FUCKS 
-A Screenplay-

Open Scene: Gentle piano music plays in the background. We're looking at the clock on the dash of a golf buggy - it's 7:22 am. A poorly dressed man takes a swig from an obviously stolen box of wine. Dont judge him - it's convenient, and delicious. By poorly dressed, of course i mean he's wearing nothing but a speedo. His outline is clearly visible. 

Cruising past a cafe at the buggy's max speed of 40kmph (It's got a turbo charger on the back), he casually reaches out and flips a buisnesman's coffee over. 

Screeching to a stop across 2 handicapped parking spaces, he strolls out, he drains the rest of the box and just throws it on the road like, he doesn't even care a little bit. not at all. 

The music's really building up now. To a big dramatic point with horns and everything. Our hero walks gallantly towards a nearby trash can, mounts it, and, without hesitation, removes his "pants" and takes a long, satisfying dump. 

Cut to horrified old lady's face. Show title.
